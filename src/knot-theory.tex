%  In every crossing point of a knot it is possible to make a crossing change: transform overcrossing to undercrossing or vice versa. The unknotting number u(k) of a knot k is the smallest number of such changes required to obtain the unknot, the minimum taken over all regular projections. According to the classical definition, we could after each change do an ambient isotropy, then perform next change in the new projection, etc., and continue in this manner until the unknot is obtained. According to the standard definition, we must perform all changes in a single (fixed) projection of k. These two definitions are equivalent [10, pp. 58]. [10] ADAMS, C.C.: The Knot Book.

% In practice, it is easy to find topological invariants which will detect non-amphicheirality, and it is exceedingly hard to detect non-invertibility. Significantly, Dehn (De) proved in 1914 that the trefoil was not amphicheiral, but the first proof of the existence of any non-invertible knots was due to Trotter (Tro) in 1964. For the important class of algebraic knots, these symmetry problems have been settled by Bonahon and Siebenmann.

% Gauss mentioned the problem of finding necessary and sufficient conditions for a sequence of 2n letters, where each letter occurs twice, to be realizable in this way as a closed curve, but apparently did not address himself further to the matter. Algorithms for deciding realizability have been written by topologists (De), and also by graph theorists (RR). An algorithm described in (DT) has been implemented as a computer program of some 30 lines, and is crucial in the tabulations of Dowker-Thistlethwaite.

% There are many other points of interest concerning the group of a knot, a few of which we indicate here. It follows immediately from Dehn's lemma (Papa) that a longitude is trivial if and only if the knot is trivial. This gives us the celebrated unknotti-ng theorem, that TTjC IR3  - K] is infinite cyclic if and only if K is trivial. If a composite K# L is trivial, the amalgamated-free-product structure of *n"i C IR3  - K # L) gives us that the groups of K and L are both isomorphic to Z . This, together with the unknotting theorem, gives us the non-canoellation theorem: if K# L is unknotted, then K and L are unknotted. For another proof, which does not use the big guns of Dehn's lemma, but which uses the fact that the genus of a knot, i.e. the

% As a consequence of the sphere theorem (Papa), the complement of a Knot in S3  is aspherical, i.e. all its higher homotopy groups are trivial. Thus the complement of a Knot in S3  is an Eileriberg-Maelane space K(G^,1) . It follows that the homotopy type of S3  - K is determined by the isomorphism class of the group G . Also it is Known that if a group G contains non^trivial elements of finite order, then K(G,1) is infinite-dimensional ((Hem), p.76). Hence we have the interesting result that a Knot group is torsion-free. Hence each meridian-longitude pair in the group of a non-trivial Knot generates a subgroup isomorphic to Z + Z . A fairly recent result (Sha) is that a Knot group cannot contain an infinitely divisible element other than the identity (an element g is infinitely divisible if it is an nth power for infinitely many n).

% Historically, the first infinite class of knots to be classified rigorously was that of torus knots, by Schreier in 1923 (Schr). The next family of Knots to be classified were the 2-bridged Knots, by Schubert in 1956 (Schu3). 

% (Burde and Zieschang have proved the striking result that torus knots are the only non-trivial knots whose groups have a non-trivial centre (BZ))
